# BankFailedDashboard

This readme file will guide you through the process of visualizing the bank failure dataset with Power BI. Power BI is a powerful business analytics tool that allows users to analyze data and create interactive visualizations. The bank failure dataset is a collection of information about banks that have failed in the United States since 2000. With Power BI, you can explore and analyze this data in a variety of ways.

Prerequisites:

Before you get started with Power BI, you will need to download the bank failure dataset. You can download the dataset from the FDIC website. You will also need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer. Power BI Desktop is a free download from Microsoft.

Getting Started:

To get started, open Power BI Desktop and click on "Get Data" in the Home ribbon. From there, select "Text/CSV" and navigate to the location where you saved the bank failure dataset. Select the file and click "Open."

In the "Navigator" window, you will see a preview of the data. You can select which tables you want to import. For this example, we will import the "banks" and "failures" tables. Click on the checkboxes next to these tables and click "Load."

Creating Visualizations:

Once you have imported the data, you can start creating visualizations. Power BI has a wide range of visualization options, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and more.

To create a visualization, select the type of chart you want to use from the "Visualizations" pane on the right-hand side of the screen. Then, drag the relevant fields from the "Fields" pane to the appropriate places on the chart.

For example, to create a bar chart showing the number of bank failures by state, you would select "Bar chart" from the "Visualizations" pane and drag the "State" field from the "Failures" table to the "Axis" field well. Then, you would drag the "Bank Name" field from the "Banks" table to the "Values" field well.

You can also add filters to your visualizations to drill down into the data. For example, you could add a filter to the above chart to only show failures that occurred after a certain date.

Sharing Your Visualizations:

Once you have created your visualizations, you can share them with others. Power BI allows you to publish your reports to the web or to a Power BI service. You can also export your visualizations to other formats, such as PDF or PowerPoint.

Power BI is a powerful tool for visualizing data. With the bank failure dataset, you can explore and analyze the data in a variety of ways. By creating visualizations, you can gain insights into the data and share those insights with others.
